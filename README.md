### General Info
***
This project is a replica of the classic tic-tac-toe game. You are Player X, and you will play against a IA, Player O.  
The objective of the game is to fill a 3x3 board until there are 3 tiles of the same player on line (in which case that player would win the game) or until the board is filled (in that case, it would be a draw if no player has won).  
It is played in turns and in each turn the player will place a token on an empty square of the
board with the objective of making 3 in a row.
